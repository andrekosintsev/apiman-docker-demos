= apiman with external Keycloak server
NOTE: Until apiman 1.0.2.Final is release, please tag the development version to it. 

----
docker tag apiman-distro-wildfly8:1.0.2-SNAPSHOT apiman/on-wildfly8:1.0.2.Final
----

This demo has *one wildfly server* with the 4 apiman capabilities (using the embedded H2 database):

* APIManager UI
* APIManager backend
* APIGateway config
* APIGateway runtime

and it has an additional *Keycloak server* on another wildfly instance, and using an embedded H2 database.

And there is an additional wildfly server with an Echo sample service. This service is accesible at *http://services:8080/apiman-echo* from the apiman server. (From the host, port 8081 is exposed locally)

NOTE: Due to a restriction on Keycloak running on docker private environments, this demo is using host networking for the apiman and keycloak server. 

== How to run the demo
To run this demo just do:

----
$ fig up
----

This will start the 3 containers in foreground.

You can experiment with the different options that http://www.fig.sh/[fig] provides, but once you have the containers created, you can *start* and *stop* them easily.

== Endpoints and ports
The demo will expose 3 ports on localhost:

- http://localhost:8080/apiman-manager[http://localhost:8080/apiman-manager (APIManager UI)]
- http://localhost:9990/console[http://localhost:9990/console (APIMan Wildfly console)]
- http://localhost:9080//auth/admin[http://localhost:9080/auth/admin (Keycloak Admin UI)]
- http://localhost:10990/console[http://localhost:10990/console (APIMan Wildfly console)]
